## Analyzing the Universe

each photon provides:
* time of arrival
* spatial position
* energy content

our eyes do not respond to differences of brightness. they respond to multiples of brightness.

delta_m = 5 => b_1/b_2 = 100

Gustav Fechner: delta_stimulus alpha (is proportional to) stimulus (Weberâ€“Fechner law)
S = k ln(I), where S=sensation and I=physical intensity of stimulus. our eyes are logarithmic detectors

speed of light in vacuum: c = 3e8 m/s

Planck: h = 6.62e-34 J s

x

1 parsec = 3 light years
1 degree = 3600 arcsec

1 rad x 180 deg/pi rad x 3600 arcsec/1 deg

1 eV = 1.6e-19 J
